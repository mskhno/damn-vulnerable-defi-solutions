## About

This repo contains my solutions for the [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://damnvulnerabledefi.xyz) challenges, version v4.

## Prerequisites

To start solving [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://damnvulnerabledefi.xyz), follow the instructions provided in this [README.md](https://github.com/theredguild/damn-vulnerable-defi/blob/98028bbbc32c189b99241ba993d69d3517837e29/README.md)

## Notes

You may use this repo to compare your solutions or to get hints, but I suggest you try to solve the challenges on your own of course. Only when you are stuck and can't think of any ways of solving the challenge, hints and solutions are available for figuring it out

I have solved 17 out of 18 levels. The list of all solved challenges is available in the [SOLVED.md](SOLVED.md) file. As of March 2025, the only unsolved level is [Wallet Mining](test/wallet-mining/WalletMining.t.sol)

Levels up to and including [Free Rider](test/free-rider/FreeRider.t.sol) have descriptions of the findings and solutions. You can find them in the according markdown file in the test directory for each level, in this case [Free Rider](test/free-rider/SOLUTION.md)

I might come back and solve the remaining level in the future, but it is highly unlikely. The same with new challenges

Keep grinding, anon
